Difference between robot prefabs:


Variation A - "damaged" robot, variation B - undamaged, with all the panels attached.

HumanBot_Skinned_A: variation A is a single skinned mesh, variation B consists of separate parts parented to skeleton

HumanBot_Skinned_A_Simple: only variation A as a single skinned mesh, not damageable

HumanBot_Skinned_B: only variation B as a single skinned mesh, not damageable

HumanBot_Skinned_Hands: all the body parts are parented directly to the skeleton (and can be detached), except for the hands (each hand is skinned as a whole)

HumanBot_Unskinned: all the body parts are parented directly to the skeleton, including each of the fingers 
(which produces quite a lot of separate parts)


_______________
Prefabs/Damage:

There are no snapping points for the "Damage" prefabs. You can put it in the corresponting bone (of the part that you are tearing off)
and rotate it so it would stick outwards.

_________
Textures:

If the visual style doesn't quite fit your project, you should check the textures in Material/Source_Textures.rar.
It contains source .psd of albedo map, and the set of textures to start a new project in Quixel DDo or Substance Painter.


___________
Animations:

No animations in the package. Can use the humanoid animations that can be found on the Asset Store.

Tested (and works well) with humanoid animations from Unity Standard Assets:

and Raw Mocap Data (from Unity)
